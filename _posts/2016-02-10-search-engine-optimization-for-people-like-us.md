# Search Engine Optimization for people like us.

Of course you know that Search Engine Optimization is important for your website. You know that it will help you be found by new potential customers, it will get you on the first page of Google, bla bla bla. But what does it all really mean? What is SEO? How does it work? Do I have to pay in blood to get good search engine rankings?

These are all questions that I've heard before, and ones that I'm sure you've asked at some point. the SEO grind is all about busting SEO myths, giving you an understanding of SEO principles, and putting the tools in your hands.

There are businesses out there who will promise to have you on the first page of Google within days. There are people who will use unethical practices to boost you in the short term, but will hurt you after they have run away with your money. Sometimes the real professionals are just too darn expensive.

You need to understand what SEO is so you can protect your business and get the maximum benefit of the internet.
